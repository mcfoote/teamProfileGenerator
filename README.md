# teamProfileGenerator
A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software dev team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each team member. You can select from manager, engineer and intern classes and fill out a series of questions to generate bootstrap cards that will be added to the generated html page. This app is executed with node.js and employs the use of the inquirer, fs, and path packages. Tested using the jest library.
